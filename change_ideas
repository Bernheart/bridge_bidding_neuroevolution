Changing lambdas

Tournament size 5 -> 3

Change population size 200 -> 100/300
 - Larger (200→300+): more genetic material, better exploration, but slower generations.
 - Smaller (200→100): faster iterations, but risk “genetic drift” and missing rare good structures.
 - Since 200 is in a comfortable middle ground, only change it if you’re hitting computational limits (too slow) or your diversity curves collapse (too fast).

Hidden layers [256] -> [256, 128]/[128]:
 - Search complexity: every additional layer means more weights for mutation/crossover to tune.
 - Bloat vs. benefit: deeper nets may overfit or bloat if you don’t counterbalance with adequate regularization or parsimony.
